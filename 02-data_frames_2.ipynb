If, for instance, we have a number of subjects investigated some of who have an inflammatory disease and some of who are healthy controls, an inflammatory marker might be increased in the diseased subjects. If several markers are recorded from each subject (i.e. more than one column in the data frame), the values of several inflammatory markers may be elevated simultaneously in the diseased subjects.
